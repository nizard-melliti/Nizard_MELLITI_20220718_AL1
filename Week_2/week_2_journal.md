D1 :
I started with the TDD approach by writing the acceptance test from the kata instruction. 
From this acceptance test came several classes: 
- lcl_game_of_life which has the next_generation method that generates the next state of the board.
- lcl_board that represents the board
- lcl_cell that represents cell inside the board

For this first iteration I don't feel like I wrote much code because there was the game understanding and design phase
